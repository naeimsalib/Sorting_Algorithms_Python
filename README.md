# Sorting_Algorithms_Python
Some of the Famous Sorting Algorithms and there Time Complexity 
<br />
<h1>BubbleSort.py</h1><br />
<P>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.</P>

<h1>InsertionSort.py</h1><br />

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.</P>

<h1>SelectionSort.py</h1><br />

selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.</P>
